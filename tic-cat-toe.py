    Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

    Initial Game Grid:
    ```
     1 | 2 | 3 
    -----------
     4 | 5 | 6 
    -----------
     7 | 8 | 9 
     ```
    A space in the grid cannot be filled twice.
    You ask the player for the mark they want to use.
    You ask the player who starts first.
    You update the board at each choice step with the correct symbol for the player.
    The game ends only if there is a winner, or there is a tie.
